# Stat 420 Data Analysis Project
## Predicting Overwatch Skill Rating

Tentative plan:
- Scrape data from overwatchtracker.com and augment with data from API ovrstat.com
- Combine data in dataframe and clean-up
- Build predictive model of SR (Skill Rating) based on data from competitive matches, such as most-played hero.
